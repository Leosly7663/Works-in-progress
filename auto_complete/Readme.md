Back in school we have to make a alphabet based trie system for storing a dictionaries worth of words
When I made this the first time is was written in C and I failed miserably, it leaked data everywhere and made me very sad
I tried valgrind, I trie to patch it but it was just too leaky, leaked all over my desk and really ruined my self esteem
but anyway
C sucks (not really)
so here I am with my new skills redeeming myself by building a trie in rust
and then we are going to build some kind of finish the word type, predictor with all words in the dictonary
ex: App__ -> App(les) 
I have not decided yet what to make the predictor choose
Maybe just shortest alphanumeric sibling?
